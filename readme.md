# PDF Narrator


This is project aims to create a trainable pdf narrator. It has had to be discontinued due to the technical limitations of my current setup (I can't train models, or even do much data preparation without my computer overheating - HP Envy M4, go figure).  
When the time comes I will continue and finish this. But for now, I need hard disk space for generative art :P


As of right now you can use the demos to read pdfs through pyttsx3
